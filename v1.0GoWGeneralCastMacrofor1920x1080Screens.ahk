; Coded by Jaleen Mackay (April 9th, 2021) for Gems of War on Steam (e.g., the PC version)
; Version 1.0 for 16:9 aspect ratio screens (1920x1080 and others)

; **IMPORTANT**
; YOU MAY BE BANNED SINCE GEMS OF WAR SAYS "NO" TO MACROS
;   â€¢ You are not allowed to "gain an unfair advantage against other players in the game" using various tools
;   â€¢ Read more here, if you like: https://gemsofwar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000348076-Hacking-or-cheating-in-Gems-of-War
;   â€¢ As an avid player, I used this macro for a long time (circa 2018) to avoid getting carpal tunnel syndrome; I have not *personally* been banned. #noragrets
;   â€¢ I categorically *do not* take responsibility for anything the Gems of War devs do in their war against accessibility, hotkeys, or fun; it is not my fault if they swing the ban hammer
;   â€¢ C a v e a t  e m p t o r ,  o n c e  a g a i n  ðŸ˜—

; **PURPOSE**
; This script is intended for smart casting troop skills during combat as well as moving quickly through the post-battle "continue" menus
;  (1) It increases accessibility for people with mobility challenges by limiting the amount of movement/clicking motions with the mouse hand, both in and out of combat
;  (2) It enables all players to have hotkeys or "smart casts" for quickly using troop skills in combat
;  (3) It enables veteran players to skip the reminder text and card image that come up when you select a troop skill
;  (4) It generally speeds up gameplay and the "fun bits" by decreasing tedious and repetitive tasks in-game, like clicking the "continue" button when you just want to get to the next battle
;  (5) Maybe it will inspire the devs to actually add hotkeys/accessibility options to their mouse-based game... 7 years later ðŸ™ƒ

; **HOW TO USE**
; During battle, pressing 1/2/3/4 will click to activate the casts of Troops 1/2/3/4 respectively, then return your mouse to its original position
; After battle, pressing the space bar will hit "skip"; press again to hit "continue" and return your mouse to its original position

; **LIMITATIONS**
; This script is *not* context sensitive, so it will limit your ability to type in global chat with 1/2/3/4 as well as use the space bar
; This script only works for 16:9 aspect ratio screens; the most common 16:9 resolution is 1920x1080 (which is what I use)
;   â€¢ Other common resolutions include 1024Ã—576, 1152Ã—648, 1280Ã—720, 1366Ã—768, 1600Ã—900, 2560Ã—1440, and 3840Ã—2160

; **CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS**
; You can remove the space bar script by deleting the "CUSTOMIZATION OPTION" line and everything below it
;   â€¢ This is useful, for example, if you regularly type in global chat (and use the space bar like a normal person)
; I suppose you could also delete all of the "smart casting" script by deleting everything from the "; PRESS 1" line down to the space before the "CUSTOMIZATION OPTION" line
; Want to change the keys used in the script, like changing the 1/2/3/4 keys to Q/W/E/R or something?
;   â€¢ Change the "#::" part of the script to "[new key]::" in each section.
;   â€¢ You can find a list of keys here: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm

; **OTHER WORKAROUNDS**
; If you want to type in global chat (using the space bar) but want to *keep* the space bar script, you can type by only pressing the space bar with another key pressed down
;   â€¢ For example, I would always press CTRL + space bar to add spaces when quickly typing in chat. You can just hold down the CTRL key the whole time, if you like
; If you want to type 1/2/3/4 in chat, you can use the num pad keys without triggering the script
